# Project Stochastic State Tracking
The working files and examples from stochastic state tracking are contained here.

## Models
This notebook contains the Hamiltonian parameters as well as dynamics set-up for each model discussed in the stochastic state tracking manuscript. Figures 3, 4, and 5 of the manuscript are generated here.

## Timings
This notebook demonstrates how to generate the 4 types of time-overlap matrices used in the timings calculations as well as how to execute the timings calculations themselves. Figure 6 in the manuscript is generated here.
